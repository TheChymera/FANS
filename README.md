#FANS

FANS (Factor Analysis of Nonstandard Sexuality) is a script suite for analysing questionnaire results for the eponymous research project.
The FANS research project tries to identify [latent variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable) in questionnaires dealing with sexual practices.
